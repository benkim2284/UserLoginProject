# UserLoginProject
A Locked-Notes App with a username & password verification system 

Do you want to write a private note that only you can see? People can be so nosy nowadays, 
so I've created a solution. Using this app, you can now create an account and write private 
messages that only you can access and edit once you log in. 

Within this project, I utilized object-oriented design and Java libraries like Swing and AWT 
to ensure a smooth user-interface experience. I also implemented serialization for the backend
system to efficiently store user data and perform password verification checks.
